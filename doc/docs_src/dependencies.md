# ðŸ§° Dependencies

To run this project, you need **Python 3.x** and the following dependencies:

## âœ… Standard Python libraries (no installation needed)
These are included with every Python distribution:

- `zipfile` â€“ for extracting the ZIP archive
- `json` â€“ for reading the config file
- `pathlib` â€“ for working with filesystem paths
- `tempfile` â€“ for creating temporary folders

## ðŸ“¦ External packages (must be installed via `pip`)
These libraries must be installed manually:

- [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/) â€“ fast XML and XSD parsing  
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) â€“ tabular data handling and CSV export  
- [`xmlschema`](https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/) â€“ optional schema-level validation *(used only in some modules)*

Install them using:

```bash
pip install lxml pandas xmlschema
```
